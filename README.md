## Hi, I'm Maryam 👋

Data analyst with experience in Excel, R, and SQL (basic). Economics (BA) and International Public Policy (MSc) graduate, currently learning SQL and Python. 

### 🛠️ Skills and Tools

### 🌱 What I'm Working On
- SQL for querying and analysis

### 💡 Background 
- Years of policy research taught me to ask "who's missing from this data?" before running analysis. I combine economics and policy thinking with technical skills recognising confounding variables, translating findings for decision-makers, and being comfortable when data contradicts itself.

### ⚡️ Fun Facts 
- I love watching thriller dramas and trying to piece together every clue before the plot twist hits
- I can't help but chase the "why" behind everything, exploring how and why things work the way they do
